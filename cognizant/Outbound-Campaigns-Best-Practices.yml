Best Practices:

Reduce the time taken to deliver a live customer to an available agent: several small things to optimize found on site

Avoid silent calls: silent calls are an extended period of silence after a person answers a call before an agent comes on the line, you can play a message back to the customer if the agent does not answer the call within a required timeframe

Manage redials:  implement a Jorney in Amazon Pinpoint

Configure maximum contact attempts over specified number of days: due to regulatory requirements you may be required to limit how often you attempt to call an endpoint over a certain number of days

Implement Opt-out or Do-no-Call (DNC) checks: via Pinpoint

Institute Calling controls based on time zone: via journeys in Pinpoint

Suppress contacts on holidays: certain regulations require customers not be contacted on specified days, will not auto-dial customers by default when no agents are available in queue or can also ensure via pinpoint

Measure metrics to support compliance: Contact Event Streams (CES) from contact can be used and observed in cloudwatch to ensure compliance
