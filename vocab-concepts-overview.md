contact centers: call centers,
amazon connect: omni channel cloud contact center that helps companies provide superior customer service at lower cost,
three deployment models for cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.
Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud: a service that lets you run virtual servers in the cloud, provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as EC2 instances
EC2 scalability: begin with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling in or out,
cloud computing: is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay as you go pricing 
                model.  You are billed only for what you use which helps you: lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, scale as your business needs change.  You are basically renting computing power and storage from someone else's datacenter.  

On premises, Private Cloud: you manage everything from servers to application.  
IAAS, Infrastructure as a Service: model closest to you managing physical servers.  The cloud provider provides 
                                    servers, however you manage virtual machine, os, runtime, as well.
PAAS, Platform as a Service: The cloud provider manages servers as well as os, virtual machine, and runtime,  
                            you manage applications and data and access.
SAAS, Software as a Service: The cloud provider manages all aspects of hardware, software, and application,
                             you only manage data and access only.

Serverless computing: means that your code runs on servers without needing to provision or manage the 
                    servers.the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the 
                    infrastructure required to run code.  These architectures are highly scalable and event driven.  They use resources only when a specific function or trigger occurs.  
AWS LAMBDA: service for serverless computing, (allows you to run code without needing to provision or manage 
            servers )
Amazon SQS, Simple Queue Service: service that allows you to send, store, and receive messages between software 
                                components, other services, or users, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.
Amazon Simple Notification Service, (SNS): publish/subscribe service where subscribers can be web servers, 
                                    email addresses, lambda functions, or several other options. 
containers: provide you with a standard way to package your application's code and dependencies into a single 
            object.  Also used for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability, and scalability.  
Amazon Elastic Container Service, (ECS): container management system that enables you to run and scale 
                                        containerized applications in AWS, highly scalable, high performance, supports Docker containers (most popular)
Amazon EKS, Elastic Kubernates Service: fully managed service that you can use to rub Kubernetes on AWS, 
                                        Kubernates is open source, scalable
AWS Cloudformation: treat your infrastructure as code, means you can build an environment by writing lines of 
                    codes instead of using the AWS management console to individually provision resources

availability zone: single data center or a group of data centers within a region
edge location: site that amazon cloudfront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers 
                for faster delivery
Amazon VPC, virtual private cloud: a networking service that allows you to establish boundaries around your AWS 
                resources, allows you to organize your resources into subnets, which are sections of a VPC that contain resources
    internet gateway: allows public traffic from the internet to access your VPC
    VPG, virtual private gateway: allows you to establish a VPN connection between your VPC and a private 
                                network, use to access private resources in a VPC
    Network Access control list, ACL: virtual firewall that checks packet permissions for subnets

Amazon Route 53: DNS web service

latency: the time between when content requested and received
